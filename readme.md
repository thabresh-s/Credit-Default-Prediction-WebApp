# Credit Default Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on improving credit risk assessment in the financial sector. We've developed a machine learning model to predict credit defaults based on a comprehensive dataset containing borrower information and loan details. By analyzing this data and using various machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide financial institutions with a tool to make informed lending decisions, reduce credit risk, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Usage
You can use this project for credit default prediction by following these steps:

- Clone this repository.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook (credit_default_prediction.ipynb) to explore the project, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- Utilize the trained model for making credit default predictions on new data.

## Model Selection
We have implemented and evaluated various machine learning algorithms for credit default prediction, including:

1. Logistic Regression
1. Random Forest
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
1. XGBoost
1. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network

The project notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of each algorithm's performance and the selection of the most effective model.

## Model Evaluation
We evaluate the model using key metrics, such as ROC AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This analysis helps us assess the model's effectiveness and its ability to balance sensitivity and specificity.

## Deployment
To deploy the model, we recommend using a Flask web application, allowing real-time credit default predictions via a user-friendly interface. Detailed deployment instructions can be found in the deployment/ directory.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, please follow the standard guidelines for open-source contributions. We welcome any enhancements, bug fixes, or new features.
