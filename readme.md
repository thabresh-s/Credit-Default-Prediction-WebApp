# Credit Default Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on improving credit risk assessment in the financial sector. We've developed a machine learning model to predict credit defaults based on a comprehensive dataset containing borrower information and loan details. By analyzing this data and using various machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide financial institutions with a tool to make informed lending decisions, reduce credit risk, and enhance customer satisfaction.
